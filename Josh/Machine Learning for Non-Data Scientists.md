# Intro
- [MVA Course on ML](http://bit.ly/2a2gi66)
- Interested in using it for a UX purpose

# Scenarios
- Manhole covers in New York City
    - Two blow up per year
- Netflix
- Predicting Diabetes with Medical Data

# Terminology

- Predictive vs Prescriptive Machine Learning
    - Predictive: Do I want to predict?
    - Prescriptive: Give me an idea and decide what to do
- Supervised vs unsupervised
    - Supervised: Monitored
        - Start with answer and tell it if it's right
    - Unsupervised: Crunches away
        - Attempts to identify trends

- Types
    - Classification: Yes/no questions "Is this manhole cover going to explode this year?"
    - Regression: Predict a value "How soon until this manhole cover explodes?"
    - Clustering: Organize this group of pictures into two groups 
        - Unsupervised
    - Recommender Systems: Recommend something (action or item) "Netflix movie recommendation"

# Workflow

Until you are happy at step 6, continue to go through these main points:


1. Business Understanding
    - Identify project objectives
2. Data Understanding
    - Collect and review data
    - Can cause going back to 1
3. Data Preparation 
    - Select and cleanse data
4. Modeling
    - Manipulate data and draw conclusions
    - Can cause going back to 3
5. Evaluation
    - Evaluate model and conclusions
    - Can cause going back to 1
6. Deployment
    - Apply conclusions to business
    - Can cause going back to 1
